# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to get us more familiar with imblearn or imblanaced learning and sklearn. These are libraries in Python that we can use to further our 
analysis and help us make predictions about the given data. We put data through various common algorithms to determine which ones ran the most effectively and that 
gave us the results given the data. 

## Results

The results of this ended with Naive Random oversampling having a 65.4% balanced accuracy rating, SMOTE oversampling having a 66.2%, the centroid cluster resampling at a 66.2%
as well, a combination have a 54.5%, the balanced forest having a 76.8% raiting, and the Easy ensemble with an astonding 91% balanced accuracy. 

## Summary 

Based on the results the clear best algorithm to use it the Easy Ensemble algorithm.
